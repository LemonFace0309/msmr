        <h1> RESILIENCE DURING COVID-19 </h1>
        <p>
          Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and during moments of uncertainty,
          change, and distress, it is important to take care of our mental
          health and maintain our resiliency. The Multi-System Model of
          Resilience has been adapted into a community resilience-building
          project to support the Chinese-Canadian and affected communities. To
          learn more and receive personalized suggestions for increasing
          resilience capacity in English, Chinese-Simplified, and
          Chinese-Traditional, visit our Project PROTECH website:
