## About

The Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR) is a copyright-protected and empirically-validated, multi-dimensional model and measure of resilience capacity across different areas in your life.

The MSMR digital application provides an opportunity for users to engage and learn about their personal resilience capacity - where they stand, and how they can improve their resilience.

This project was built with NextJS and Strapi.
